    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      üéì As a third-year Information Technology student at North-West University, I'm constantly fascinated by the power of technology and its potential to shape our future. My academic journey, which began in 2023 (though let's be honest, my passion for tech ignited back when my parents brought home our first home PC running Windows XP!), is set to conclude in 2026. This journey has focused on building a strong understanding of core IT principles and practical applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      üíª I've gained proficiency in several key programming languages, including Java, C#, SQL, and Delphi, which I learned in depth from taking IT subjects in high school. I've also dabbled in C++. Beyond coding, I've honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, and I thrive in collaborative environments, leveraging effective communication to achieve shared goals. I'm a quick study, always ready to embrace new technologies and challenges. My passion for creativity extends to the visual realm; I love designing things like UX/UI and coming up with concepts for app and website components.
    </p>
    <p> 
      üéß When I'm not diving into code or design, you can often find me immersing myself in the world of music, whether it's discovering new artists or revisiting old favorites. And, of course, a good gaming session is always a welcome way to unwind and engage my strategic thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      üåê I'm excited about the prospect of applying my skills in a professional setting and am actively seeking internship opportunities to kickstart my career in IT. <a href="contact.html">Let's connect</a> if you'd like to discuss the latest IT trends, potential collaborations, or even share your favorite game or music recommendations!
